# Todo Application (Redux)

Currently i'm learning redux. That's why i make a simple todo application using redux.

- Add and remove todo
- Mark the todo as a significant color and can change the color.
- Make the todo complete or incomplete.
- Can make all todos as completed.
- Clear all completed todos.
- Filter the todo by 3 category (all, complete, incomplete).
- Filter the todo by todo's color.
